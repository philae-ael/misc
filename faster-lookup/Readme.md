# Several implementations of comparaison based searches

I wanted to use heavily the reference. BUT:
- The reference date from 2017
- It seems the initial test were done on an AMD machine? (maybe too early?) bc cmov performance seems okay?

So i will use the reference but the data may be different. Well good.
